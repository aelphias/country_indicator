The gi module is used to access the GObject Introspection API, which allows Python code to interact with libraries that have been compiled for use with other programming languages. In this code snippet, the gi module is used to access the GTK and AppIndicator3 libraries, which are used to create a system tray icon that displays the user's country code.

The requests module is also imported to make an HTTP request to the ipinfo.io/country API endpoint to retrieve the user's country code.
